# 🚀 PROJECT CHIMERA ASCENDANT - PHASE 2

**Production Deployment & Real-World Validation**

Phase 2 transforms the validated Phase 1 foundation into a production-ready fitness coaching system with real human data integration.

---

## 🎯 QUICK START

### **1. Collect Real Human Data**
```bash
# Record human squat sessions
cd phase2/data_collection
python human_squat_recorder.py --participant "user001" --duration 30

# Validate against synthetic data
python data_validator.py --synthetic ../../quantumleap-v3/data/synthetic_squat_dataset.h5 --human ./human_data
```

### **2. Fine-Tune Model on Real Data**
```bash
# Transfer learning from synthetic to real data
cd phase2/training
python transfer_learning.py --pretrained ../../quantumleap-v3/training/trained_model.pth --human_data ../data_collection/human_data
```

### **3. Deploy to iOS**
```bash
# Convert fine-tuned model to Core ML
cd ../../quantumleap-v3/deployment
python simple_coreml_converter.py --model ../../phase2/training/human_finetuned_model.pth
```
